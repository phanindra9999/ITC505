      <h1>SCENE II. The Mart</h1>

      <p>
        <strong
          >Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse, DROMIO of Syracuse, and First
          Merchant</strong
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>First Merchant:</strong> Therefore give out you are of
        Epidamnum,<br />
        Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.<br />
        This very day a Syracusian merchant<br />
        Is apprehended for arrival here;<br />
        And not being able to buy out his life<br />
        According to the statute of the town,<br />
        Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.<br />
        There is your money that I had to keep.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:</strong> Go bear it to the Centaur,
        where we host,<br />
        And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.<br />
        Within this hour it will be dinner-time:<br />
        Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,<br />
        Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,<br />
        And then return and sleep within mine inn,<br />
        For with long travel I am stiff and weary.<br />
        Get thee away.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:</strong> Many a man would take you at your
        word,<br />
        And go indeed, having so good a mean.
      </p>

      <p><em>Exit DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</em></p>

      <p>
        <strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:</strong> A trusty villain, sir, that
        very oft,<br />
        When I am dull with care and melancholy,<br />
        Lightens my humour with his merry jests.<br />
        What, will you walk with me about the town,<br />
        And then go to my inn and dine with me?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>First Merchant:</strong> I am invited, sir, to certain
        merchants,<br />
        Of whom I hope to make much benefit;<br />
        I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,<br />
        Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart<br />
        And afterward consort you till bed-time:<br />
        My present business calls me from you now.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:</strong> Farewell till then: I will go
        lose myself<br />
        And wander up and down to view the city.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>First Merchant:</strong> Sir, I commend you to your own content.
      </p>

      <p><em>Exit First Merchant</em></p>

      <p>
        <strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:</strong> He that commends me to mine own
        content<br />
        Commends me to the thing I cannot get.<br />
        I to the world am like a drop of water<br />
        That in the ocean seeks another drop,<br />
        Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,<br />
        Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:<br />
        So I, to find a mother and a brother,<br />
        In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Enter DROMIO of Ephesus</strong></p>

      <p>
        <strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:</strong> Here comes the almanac of my
        true date.<br />
        What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS:</strong> Return'd so soon! rather approach'd
        too late:<br />
        The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,<br />
        The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;<br />
        My mistress made it one upon my cheek:<br />
        She is so hot because the meat is cold;<br />
        The meat is cold because you come not home;<br />
        You come not home because you have no stomach;<br />
        You have no stomach having broke your fast;<br />
        But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray<br />
        Are penitent for your default to-day.

      <h2>Addendum</h2>
      <p>
        Overview of some of the more interesting stylistic choices I made in this lab's CSS:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Font Choices:</strong> I set the body text to 'Georgia' to give the page a formal,
          sophisticated feel; headings are in 'Merriweather',
          which provides a good contrast and makes them stand out much better.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Heading and Text Sizes:</strong> I 
          made <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> a larger font size of 2.5rem and then centered it for readability and prominence.
          For the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, I used a relatively smaller size at 1.8rem. 
          I then applied a font size of 1.1rem to all regular paragraph texts for better readability.

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Color Choices:</strong> 
          A dark grey was chosen for body text (#333) to make reading easy on a light background (#f4f4f9). 
          Character names are underlined in dark red (#c0392b) to be noticed, while stage directions, grey (#7f8c8d), are italicized to be subtle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Margin and Padding Choices:</strong> The padding was given 20px, 
          and margins were given 40px at the bottom of article sections, 
          thus giving good separations. Paragraphs and other elements have spacing appropriate for readability.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>HTML Abuse</h3>
      <p>
        No abuse of HTML in the structure. 
        Headings and tags have been used semantically correctly for the scene below.
      </p>

    <!-- Footer with last updated information as given in the question-->
    <footer>
      <p>
        Last updated:
        <span id="lastModified"></span>
      </p>
    </footer>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      var x = document.lastModified;
      document.getElementById("lastModified").textContent = x;
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
