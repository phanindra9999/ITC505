        <h1>SCENE II. The Mart</h1>

        <p><strong>Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse, DROMIO of Syracuse, and First Merchant</strong></p>
        
        <p><strong>First Merchant:</strong> Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum,<br>
        Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.<br>
        This very day a Syracusian merchant<br>
        Is apprehended for arrival here;<br>
        And not being able to buy out his life<br>
        According to the statute of the town,<br>
        Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.<br>
        There is your money that I had to keep.</p>
        
        <p><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:</strong> Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,<br>
        And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.<br>
        Within this hour it will be dinner-time:<br>
        Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,<br>
        Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,<br>
        And then return and sleep within mine inn,<br>
        For with long travel I am stiff and weary.<br>
        Get thee away.</p>

        <p><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:</strong> Many a man would take you at your word,<br>
        And go indeed, having so good a mean.</p>
        
        <p><em>Exit DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</em></p>

        <p><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:</strong> A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,<br>
        When I am dull with care and melancholy,<br>
        Lightens my humour with his merry jests.<br>
        What, will you walk with me about the town,<br>
        And then go to my inn and dine with me?</p>

        <p><strong>First Merchant:</strong> I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,<br>
        Of whom I hope to make much benefit;<br>
        I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,<br>
        Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart<br>
        And afterward consort you till bed-time:<br>
        My present business calls me from you now.</p>

        <p><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:</strong> Farewell till then: I will go lose myself<br>
        And wander up and down to view the city.</p>

        <p><strong>First Merchant:</strong> Sir, I commend you to your own content.</p>
        
        <p><em>Exit First Merchant</em></p>

        <p><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:</strong> He that commends me to mine own content<br>
        Commends me to the thing I cannot get.<br>
        I to the world am like a drop of water<br>
        That in the ocean seeks another drop,<br>
        Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,<br>
        Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:<br>
        So I, to find a mother and a brother,<br>
        In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.</p>

        <p><strong>Enter DROMIO of Ephesus</strong></p>

        <p><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE:</strong> Here comes the almanac of my true date.<br>
        What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?</p>

        <p><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS:</strong> Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:<br>
        The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,<br>
        The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;<br>
        My mistress made it one upon my cheek:<br>
        She is so hot because the meat is cold;<br>
        The meat is cold because you come not home;<br>
        You come not home because you have no stomach;<br>
        You have no stomach having broke your fast;<br>
        But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray<br>
        Are penitent for your default to-day.</p>

        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>This document was structured to present a scene from Shakespeare's <em>The Comedy of Errors</em> in a clean and accessible format using semantic HTML elements. Here's a breakdown of the elements and reasoning:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>&lt;article&gt; Tag:</strong> The entire scene is enclosed in an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag to signify that it's a self-contained section of a larger work, making it easy for search engines and assistive technologies to understand.</li>
            <li><strong>&lt;h1&gt; Tag:</strong> The scene title "SCENE II. The Mart" is placed inside an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag as it's the most important heading in this section.</li>
            <li><strong>&lt;strong&gt; Tag:</strong> The names of the characters are enclosed in <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tags to emphasize who is speaking, improving readability for the audience.</li>
            <li><strong>&lt;p&gt; Tag:</strong> The dialogues and narration are enclosed in <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags to provide separation between different parts of the text. This aids in clarity and structure.</li>
            <li><strong>&lt;br&gt; Tag:</strong> To preserve the line breaks in the verse, I used <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tags between each line within the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements.</li>
            <li><strong>&lt;em&gt; Tag:</strong> Italicized text, like "Exit DROMIO OF SYRACUSE" or stage directions, is marked with the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag for emphasis. This provides additional context for readers on stage actions.</li>
            <li><strong>Footer:</strong> The footer contains a JavaScript script that dynamically updates the "Last updated" date. This was implemented to ensure that any post-submission updates are correctly timestamped.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The structure of the HTML ensures accessibility, readability, and proper presentation of the original Shakespearean text. Semantic HTML enhances the documentâ€™s SEO and makes it easier for screen readers to navigate through the different sections of the page.</p>
    </article>

    <!-- Footer with last updated information -->
    <footer>
        <p>Last updated: 
            <span id="lastModified"></span>
        </p>
    </footer>
    <script type="text/javascript">
         var x = document.lastModified;
         document.getElementById('lastModified').textContent = x;
    </script>
